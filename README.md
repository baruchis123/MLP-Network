# MLP Network
### This program was given as the first assignment in the CPP part of the C\CPP workshop course in the Computer Science program of the Hebrew University. This program implements a MLP NN designed to read images of handwritten digits with high predictability, helping learn concepts in OOP and CPP such as classes, const & const return types, references and operator overloading.
